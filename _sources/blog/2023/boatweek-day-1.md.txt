# Boat Week: Monday, Day 1
## Getting slapped by a bin bag
Emily spent the morning beginning to remove the broken front of the boat (reminder pictured).
Unfortunately the weather was pretty unforgiving and it had been raining overnight and the whole day was extremely windy. 
The cling film greenhouse was actively shredding itself on the pergola and the ladders in the high winds.
To add insult to injury, it was noisily and continuously slapping Emily as she tried to work.
She also began to worry that it might take off down the sheet or end up in a neighbour's garden.

While Emily visited Wilko's for some pic'n'mix and duct tape, the shelter shredded itself even more. 
It became clear the duct tape was not going to work.

## Doomscrolling and desperation

I'm beginning to think buying this boat was not a good idea

At lunchtime the Cap'n came inside for some cold leftover pizza, and she was in a sorry emotional state.
The suggestions of the boatswain ("You could buy some garden sails? Or some plastic corrugated roofing sheets? Or a gazebo? Or find a garage to rent?") all seemed hopeless to the Captain in that moment.
After a necessary few hours of sad doomscrolling, spirits were raised enough to make some panicked posts to local facebook and whatsapp groups, and to begin to hatch a plan.
Reassured with tales of the garden being waterproofed for a party with garden sails one time, the sail option seemed more appealing (and affordable). 
Unfortunately, none were in stock to collect that day in the city. 
The local Toolstation however had a large "medium-duty" tarp, which seemed close enough in a pinch (and to be clear, *we were* in a pinch).

## Tarps to the rescue! 
The weather clearned up while Emily vengefully taking down the old clingfilm greenhouse down.
It's demise soothed the Captain's soul.
Then (after a first trip to toolstation), Emily began assembling a new makeshift tarp shelter. 
The tarp wasn't quite big enough, so a 2nd (larger!) tarp soon joined it's brother (after a second trip to toolstation).
Between the two tarps and an old garden sail, the new tarp shelter was formed. 
Although we were still looking at it mostly in the dry, so the jury is still very much out, the tarps were much less noisy and wet than the cling film and we were feeling hopeful.
There wasn't time for much else today - what a rollercoaster!
