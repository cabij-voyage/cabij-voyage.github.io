# A history of Cabij

Cabij is a wooden Mirror sailing dinghy: a boat originally promoted by the Daily Mirror.
{ref}`He<cabij-boy>` was acquired by Captain Emily Pole in 2018; she hadn't sailed before, but she *is* in a {ref}`sea shanty band<slugbeard>`, which seemed qualification enough to buy a boat.

Above: Cabij in 2018, just before Captain Emily became the owner.

Emily was told that Cabij should float, given a lick of paint, but we don't know the last time he's been on the water - surely before 2018.

## Captain Emily and Slugbeard
Emily has been in a sea shanty band since 2018: slugbeard. 
They're a silly, four piece band, formed in Bristol, who perform instrumental covers of sea shanties and pirate punk songs, with some nautical originals thrown in for good measure.
The good ship Cabij therefore serves a strong purpose as an elaborate cosplay accessory.

(cabij-cabbage)=
Slugs love cabbages and that's why Cabij is a cabbage.
A slugbeard fan is also called a Cabbage.

(cabij-boy)=
Furthermore, since it's traditional for boats to be women, Cabij is a lad. 

(grand-plans)=
## Grand plans

Cabij may be but a small wooden sailing dinghy, but he has big plans, to:
- Be decorated like a cabbage.
- Sport a beautiful slug figurehead.
- Be officially renamed in a poseidan naming ceremony.
- Sail down the Avon gorge!
- Go dingy cruising.
- Should he sink, be immortalised as furniture. 
- Share his story!
