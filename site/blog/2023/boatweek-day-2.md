# Boat Week: Tuesday, Day 2
## Lie-in & tarp-management
Captain Emily woke up a little late, but just in time to see how well the tarp held up in the rain.
It was a relief to see the new tarp house was much more water and wind proof, although still a little puddly.

The early afternoon was spent shoring up the tarp tent a little further, and using it to dry off clothes/air the ship's dirty laundry.

## New bow rail
There was a difficult bike-journey to the shop (featuring a road closure) to buy wood for the replacement of the bow.
The Cap'n then began to cut that to size and the 2nd round of repairs had begun!

The wood continued to be shaped until the Captain was falling asleep at her ship in the cosy glow of the tarp, and had to call it a day.
